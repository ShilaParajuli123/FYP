<br><p>As the Name suggests, Le Trio is owned by three different owners. Their passion for good hygienic food made them establish this restaurant in Jhamsikhel, Pulchwok has now opened a new outlet at Durbarmarg for the convenience of the customer. The restaurant is best known for its Momo Cha with Jhol Achar. Trio momochas are freshly made only on demand. This multi cuisine restaurant has a cozy indoor seating arrangement with separate space for smokers and non smokers, and has a total table capacity of 40 persons. The most popular on the menu, apart from the Momo Cha are Crispy Potatoes, Buffalo wings and the scrumptious desserts. <br>

Trio may seem a small area for a proper restaurant. But go by the food and the hospitality it serves its guests, for sure you will not leave disappointed. And there is something special about this restaurant that will make you go back there again and again.
